                    <p class="dropCap"><span id="firstWord">Let</span> us suppose that there was<br>no other star in the
                        universe<br>than our own sun, and let us<br>further, for the sake of
                        making<br>the argument clearer, suppose<br>that the sun was deprived
                        of its<br>system of attendant worlds. Next, let some<br>other object
                        be introduced which we may<br>suppose to be extremely light, like a
                        wisp of<br>vapour, and let it be situated at a distance<br>from the
                        sun which we may regard as inde<br>finitely great. These two bodies,
                        namely,<br>the sun and this wisp of vapour, are then<br>supposed to
                        be abandoned to their mutual<br>attraction. Each of these objects will
                        pull<br>the other, and the result of the attraction<br>between the
                        two bodies will be to make them<br>approach each other. As, however,
                        the<br>mass of the sun is so vast, while the mass<br>of the wisp is
                        so small, we may fairly<br>assume that the greater part of this
                        move<br>ment will be done by the wisp, while the sun<br>will remain
                        comparatively at rest. The case<br>is indeed much of the same in this
                        respect as in<br>the fall of a stone to the ground. The
                        stone<br>goes down to meet the earth, but the earth<br>at the same
                        time comes up to meet the stone.<br>As, however, the earth is more
                        massive than<br>millions of millions of stones, the
                        actual<br>movement performed by the earth is in this<br>case quite
                        unappreciable. We may therefore<br>say, with truth enough for all
                        practical<br>purposes, that it is the stone which does all<br><span>the
                        moving, while the earth remains at rest.</span></p>
                    <p>In the same manner we may suppose the<br>sun to be at rest, while the
                        wisp of vapour<br>is drawn towards it from the depths of
                        space.<br>At first, no doubt the motion may be<br> extremely slow:
                        for the attraction of the<br>sun decreases with its distance.
                        Indeed,<br>the wisp of vapour might be so remote, that<br>it would
                        require thousands of years to move<br>over an inch. But as the motion
                        progresses<br>the body will gradually acquire speed, until<br>after
                        the lapse of a time, so long that we shall<br>not attempt to express
                        it in figures, the little<br>object will be found hurrying in towards
                        the<br>sun with the speed of an express train; still<br>the pace
                        will grow until the approaching<br>object will be moving as quickly as
                        a rifle<br>bullet. The intervening distance is now<br>rapidly
                        dimishing; but, as that distance<br></div>
                <div class="vol">Vol. xxi.-50.</div>
                <div class="columnRight">
                    lessens, the intensity of the solar
                    attraction<br>increases, and, consequently, the pace at<br>which the
                    object is urged onwards becomes<br>greater and greater. From moving at
                    the<br>rate of a mile in a second, the little object<br>would gradually
                    attain a speed not less<br>than that of the earth in its orbit,
                    namely,<br>about eighteen miles a second. Still<br>the body presses
                    onwards, until a pace could<br>be reached of 100 or 200 miles a
                    second.<br>Finally, when the vapour would be about to<br>make the
                    terrific plunge into the glowing sun,<br>its speed would be upwards of 400
                    miles a<br>second. The vastness of this speed may<br>be realized from
                    the fact that a body<br>animated by so great a velocity
                    would<br>accomplish a complete circuit of the earth<br><span>in about a
                    minute.</span><p>The case which I have supposed is, how<br>ever, not
                        exactly that of a comet. The<br>movement would hardly take place in
                        the<br>way just described, in which the sun and<br>the wisp of
                        vapour were both orginally<br>at rest. Such a state of things could
                        hardly<br>be possible in Nature. We may, no doubt,<br>suppose the
                        sun to have been at rest, for it<br>is only the relative movements of
                        the two<br>bodies which concern us. But we can hardly<br>imagine
                        that the wisp of vapour could have<br>been so delicately placed as to
                        have had<br>absolutely no motion whatever, except, in<br>deed, in
                        the direct line towards the sun. If,<br>at the moment of starting, the
                        object pos<br>essed a movement which would carry it in<br>the course
                        of time out of the direct line<br>to the sun, then a totally different
                        condition<br><span>of motion would be the result.</span></p>
                    <p>All the time that the sun was drawing this<br>wisp of vapour
                        towards it, the transverse move<br>ment would be gradually moving the
                        wisp<br>out of the direct line. Now, though the<br>speed of that
                        movement may be very small,<br>yet in the lapse of those millions
                        of<br>years that are required to draw the body into the<br>sun, this
                        transverse movement will have<br>increased to such an extent that the
                        object<br>will the miss the sun instead of hitting it. In<br>fact,
                        after its stupendous voyage from the<br>indefinitely remote depths of
                        space, during<br>which it has acquired its vast speed of
                        scores<br>or hundreds of miles a second, the comet will<br>be found
                        not plunging into the sun, but

                    passing to one side of it. While the two
                    <br>objects are in such close proximity their
                    <br>mutual attraction is, of course, of tremendous
                    <br>vehemence. In virtue of this attraction, the
                    <br>rapidly moving comet is whirled round the
                    <br>sun, and consequently begins to retreat again
                    <br>towards the same side from which it has
                    <br>come. In this majestic sweep the comet
                    <br>describes a graceful curve. Coming in from
                    <br>infinity it approaches the sun, wheels round
                    <br>the sun, and then again retires to the depths
                    <span><br>of space.</span>
                    <p>
                        As the comet has swept in towards the
                        <br>sun, in consequence of the attraction of that
                        <br>body, it may seem difficult to understand
                        <br>why it should then retreat outwards again,
                        <br>notwithstanding the attraction which now
                        <br>seeks to draw it back. This may, however,
                        <br>be illustrated by a very simple contrivance.
                        <br>Let a weight be hung from the ceiling by a
                        <br>string. Let that weight be drawn to aside and
                        <br>then released. It will, of course, swing down
                        <br>to the lowest point, and then, having passed
                        <br>through the lowest point, the weight will
                        <br>begin to ascend. The attraction of the earth
                        <br>pulls the body down, but as it descends it
                        <br>acquires speed, and in virtue of this speed
                        <br>it is enabled to pass the lowest point and to
                        <br>ascend in opposition to gravity on the other
                        <br>side. In the same way, the speed acquired
                        <br>by the comet in its long voyage towards the
                        <br>sun from the depths of space enables it to
                        <br>sweep round the sun without being captured,
                        <br>and then to pass away, perhaps, never more
                        <br>to return. The nearer the comet is to the
                        <br>solar surface the greater is the speed with
                        <br>which it moves, and consequently the more
                        <br>brief is its sojourn in the vicinity of the sun.
                        <br>A comet has, in fact, been known to graze the
                        <br>sun so closely that it passed within one-
                        <br>seventh part of the sun's radius. In this
                        <br>case a period of two hours sufficed for the
                        <br>comet to completely turn round the sun
                        <span><br>and commence its retreat into space.</span></p>
                    <p>The actual circumstances presented in
                        <br>Nature are not quite so
                        simple. We have
                        <br>assumed that the sun and the comet were
                        <br>the
                        solitary objects in the universe. Of
                        <br>course, this condition is not
                        fulfilled. There
                        <br>are the planets surrounding the sun, and
                        <br>then
                        there are the countless hosts of stars. Some
                        <br>of these objects may
                        attract the comet with
                        <br>a vigour sufficient to sway it
                        considerably
                        <br>from the track which it would otherwise
                        <br>follow. In
                        consequence of these various
                        <br>forces we are not justified in discussing
                        the
                        <br>problem actually presented in Nature as
                        <br>being exactly the same
                        as that in the case
                        <br>hitherto supposed. But our illustrations
                        will,</div>
                <div class="columnRight">at all events, suffice to give a general idea of<br>what
                    actually happens. The comets are<br>drawn in from the depths of space,
                    they<br>approach the sun, they sweep round the sun,<br>and they then retreat
                    again to the abyss from<br>which they have come. The laws of mathe<br>matics
                    assure us that it is quite possible for<br>an object, after journeying from an
                    immeasur<br>ably great distance for an immeasurably long<br>time, to enter
                    our system, to wheel round the<br>sun and then again retreat to commence
                    an<br>infinite voyage which should last for all<br>eternity. It is perfectly
                    certain that this kind<br>of motion, which we know to be possible<br>does
                    closely resemble that actually performed<br>by many of the comets. These
                    bodies enter<br>our system, they come into the vicinity of the<br>earth,
                    and, under these circumstances, they<br>are accessible to our observation. As
                    they<br>retreat into space they gradually withdraw<br>from our view. Many of
                    the comets which<br>come to visit us appear to be objects which<br>have
                    never been within the ken of the earth<br>before, and which will never be
                    within the<span><br>ken of the earth again.</span> 
                    <p>There are, however, a few of
                        these bodies<br>which describe orbits of a different kind.<br>They move
                        round in elliptic or oval paths,<br>so that their visits to our vicinity
                        and their<br>consequent visibility to the inhabitants of<br>the earth
                        recur with more or less regularity.<br>Of such a nature is that most
                        famous of all<br>comets, which bears the name of the
                        illustrious<br>astronomer Halley. This splendid object<br>accomplishes a
                        complete circuit around the<br>sun every seventy-five years. It will
                        again<br>display its splendours for terrestrial admira<span><br>tion about the
                        year 1910.</span></p>
                    <p>Our knowledge of comets has been greatly<br>extended in the last few
                        years by the applica<br>tion of photographic methods to the
                        investi<br>gation of the heavens. Indeed, we are<br>evidently now
                        entering upon a new phase in<br>the history of these
                        mysterious<br>objects. The advantages of photography for<br>such

                        pictures of<br>absolute accuracy. This is a matter of<br>special
                        importance in this research, because<br>the appearance of comets changes
                        so in<br>cessantly, that unless the portrait of the<br>comet obtained on

                        to<br>correct it on any subsequent occasion. Not<br>only from week to
                        week does the comet alter<br>its appearance, but it changes even from
                        day<br>to day. It is, therefore, of the utmost im<br>portance to obtain

                    passing to one side of it. While the two
                    <br>objects are in such close proximity their
                    <br>mutual attraction is, of course, of tremendous
                    <br>vehemence. In virtue of this attraction, the
                    <br>rapidly moving comet is whirled round the
                    <br>sun, and consequently begins to retreat again
                    <br>towards the same side from which it has
                    <br>come. In this majestic sweep the comet
                    <br>describes a graceful curve. Coming in from
                    <br>infinity it approaches the sun, wheels round
                    <br>the sun, and then again retires to the depths
                    <span><br>of space.</span>
                    <p>
                        As the comet has swept in towards the
                        <br>sun, in consequence of the attraction of that
                        <br>body, it may seem difficult to understand
                        <br>why it should then retreat outwards again,
                        <br>notwithstanding the attraction which now
                        <br>seeks to draw it back. This may, however,
                        <br>be illustrated by a very simple contrivance.
                        <br>Let a weight be hung from the ceiling by a
                        <br>string. Let that weight be drawn to aside and
                        <br>then released. It will, of course, swing down
                        <br>to the lowest point, and then, having passed
                        <br>through the lowest point, the weight will
                        <br>begin to ascend. The attraction of the earth
                        <br>pulls the body down, but as it descends it
                        <br>acquires speed, and in virtue of this speed
                        <br>it is enabled to pass the lowest point and to
                        <br>ascend in opposition to gravity on the other
                        <br>side. In the same way, the speed acquired
                        <br>by the comet in its long voyage towards the
                        <br>sun from the depths of space enables it to
                        <br>sweep round the sun without being captured,
                        <br>and then to pass away, perhaps, never more
                        <br>to return. The nearer the comet is to the
                        <br>solar surface the greater is the speed with
                        <br>which it moves, and consequently the more
                        <br>brief is its sojourn in the vicinity of the sun.
                        <br>A comet has, in fact, been known to graze the
                        <br>sun so closely that it passed within one-
                        <br>seventh part of the sun's radius. In this
                        <br>case a period of two hours sufficed for the
                        <br>comet to completely turn round the sun
                        <span><br>and commence its retreat into space.</span></p>
                    <p>The actual circumstances presented in
                        <br>Nature are not quite so
                        simple. We have
                        <br>assumed that the sun and the comet were
                        <br>the
                        solitary objects in the universe. Of
                        <br>course, this condition is not
                        fulfilled. There
                        <br>are the planets surrounding the sun, and
                        <br>then
                        there are the countless hosts of stars. Some
                        <br>of these objects may
                        attract the comet with
                        <br>a vigour sufficient to sway it
                        considerably
                        <br>from the track which it would otherwise
                        <br>follow. In
                        consequence of these various
                        <br>forces we are not justified in discussing
                        the
                        <br>problem actually presented in Nature as
                        <br>being exactly the same
                        as that in the case
                        <br>hitherto supposed. But our illustrations
                        will,</div>
                <div class="columnRight">at all events, suffice to give a general idea of<br>what
                    actually happens. The comets are<br>drawn in from the depths of space,
                    they<br>approach the sun, they sweep round the sun,<br>and they then retreat
                    again to the abyss from<br>which they have come. The laws of mathe<br>matics
                    assure us that it is quite possible for<br>an object, after journeying from an
                    immeasur<br>ably great distance for an immeasurably long<br>time, to enter
                    our system, to wheel round the<br>sun and then again retreat to commence
                    an<br>infinite voyage which should last for all<br>eternity. It is perfectly
                    certain that this kind<br>of motion, which we know to be possible<br>does
                    closely resemble that actually performed<br>by many of the comets. These
                    bodies enter<br>our system, they come into the vicinity of the<br>earth,
                    and, under these circumstances, they<br>are accessible to our observation. As
                    they<br>retreat into space they gradually withdraw<br>from our view. Many of
                    the comets which<br>come to visit us appear to be objects which<br>have
                    never been within the ken of the earth<br>before, and which will never be
                    within the<span><br>ken of the earth again.</span> 
                    <p>There are, however, a few of
                        these bodies<br>which describe orbits of a different kind.<br>They move
                        round in elliptic or oval paths,<br>so that their visits to our vicinity
                        and their<br>consequent visibility to the inhabitants of<br>the earth
                        recur with more or less regularity.<br>Of such a nature is that most
                        famous of all<br>comets, which bears the name of the
                        illustrious<br>astronomer Halley. This splendid object<br>accomplishes a
                        complete circuit around the<br>sun every seventy-five years. It will
                        again<br>display its splendours for terrestrial admira<span><br>tion about the
                            year 1910.</span></p>
                    <p>Our knowledge of comets has been greatly<br>extended in the last few
                        years by the applica<br>tion of photographic methods to the
                        investi<br>gation of the heavens. Indeed, we are<br>evidently now
                        entering upon a new phase in<br>the history of these
                        mysterious<br>objects. The advantages of photography for<br>such
                        inquiries are obvious. In the first<br>place, the plates present to us
                        pictures of<br>absolute accuracy. This is a matter of<br>special
                        importance in this research, because<br>the appearance of comets changes
                        so in<br>cessantly, that unless the portrait of the<br>comet obtained on

                        <p>The first notable achievement in the<br>determination
                            of the peculiar character of<br>the radiation from a comet was made
                            by<br>Dr.
                            Huggins in 1868. He
                            showed that<br>some of the rays of a comet which appeared<br>that year were indicative of the presence of<br>the
                            element carbon in the body of the object.<br>In the case of this
                            particular element the<br>available information carried us somewhat<br>further than is often the case. Not only was<br>the
                            existence of the element demonstrated, but<br>the particular chemical
                            combination in which<br>that element appeared was disclosed. By its<br>union with hydrogen, carbon gives rise to<br>an
                            important series of compounds. The<br>substances thus produced are very
                            familiar.<br>It need only be mentioned that the common<br>petroleum, which we use in our lamps, is a<br>combination of carbon and hydrogen! The<br>spectrum of a
                            hydro-carbon, as one of these<br>compounds is termed, is of such a
                            charac<br>teristic nature that it can be used as a<br>test to show whether the hydro-carbon<br>itself is present. Dr. Huggins
                            compared the<br>spectrum of the comet now referred to with<br>the spectrum of these hydro-carbons. The<br>identity
                            between the two spectra was noted,<br>and thus a splendid addition was
                            a once<br>made to our knowledge. Subsequent research<br>has confirmed the important discovery that<br>hydro-carbons are
                            characteristic components<br><span>of many comets.</span></p>
                        
                        <p>For many years no further important<br>addition was
                            made to our knowledge of the<br>elementary substances present in
                            these<br>wandering bodies. The light they dispensed<br>appeared to be partly the reflected light from<br>the sun, and partly
                            the light due to incan<br>descent hydro-carbons. But in 1882 a great<br>advance was made. A comet was
                            discovered<br>that year in Albany, by Mr.
                            Wells. At first,<br>this body
                            showed the bright continuos<br>spectrum due to reflected sunlight, while the<br><span>indications of the presence of hydro-carbon</span></div>
                    <div class="columnRight">were mainly confined to the neighborhood<br>of the nucleus. After this interesting<br>object had
                        adorned the heavens for a<br>couple of months Dr. Copeland, now the<br>distinguished Astronomer-Royal of Scotland,<br>discovered a bright yellow
                        line in the spectrum<br>indicating the presence of sodium. This<br>observation was of particular importance,<br>inasmuch
                        as it afforded at once direct<br>evidence of the presence in these
                        celestial<br>wanderers of another element specially re<br>markable in its terrestrial relations. An<br>emphatic
                        confirmation of Copeland's dis<br>covery was presently forthcoming. It is well<br>known that the bright
                        yellow line indicative<br>of the presence of sodium is seen to be<br>double when examined under suitable cir<br>cumstances.
                        As the comet appraoched the<br>sun the characteristic sodium light
                        became<br>quite strong. The nucleus glared with the<br>distinct yellow hue belonging to this element;<br>and, indeed, by
                        filtering away all other light<br>in a process with which a
                        spectroscopist is<br>familiar, an outline of the head of the comet<br>was obtained which was produced by sodium<br><span>light
                        alone.</span>
                        
                        <p>To Dr.
                            Copeland and Dr. Lohse at the <br>Earl of Crawford's observatory in Dunecht<br>we are also indebted for
                            yet one more im<br>portant addition to our knowledge of the com<br>position of these bodies. In the autumn of<br>1882 we were visited by another comet, which<br>must rank as one of the most famous of these<br>objects which have appeared during this<br>century. On the 18th September, 1882, the<br>two
                            astronomers I have named observed in<br>the spectrum of this comet, not
                            only the<br>sodium line, but also six other lines.<br>The
                            places of these were carefully measured,<br>and it was found afterwards
                            that they were<br>undoubtedly the chief lines of the iron spec<br>trum. Here was, indeed, another notable dis<br>covery.
                            The element iron, of such transcen<br>dent importance to us on the
                            earth, is now<br>known to be a constituent of the cometary<br><span>wanderers throughout space.</span></p>
                        
                        <p>Thus we have learned that the principal<br>elements in
                            comets are among the common<br>substances on the earth. Here, again,
                            we<br>find additional testimony to that fundamental<br>unity in the composition of heavenly bodies,<br>the perception of
                            which is one of the most<br><span>notable results in modern science.</span></p></div>
