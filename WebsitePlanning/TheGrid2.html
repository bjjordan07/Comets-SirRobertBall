                    <p>When we examine the photograph of a<br>comet, we thus often find on it many

                        found that the tail of<br>the comet, as it is depicted on the plates,
                        is<br>three times as extensive as the tail of the<br>same body as it is

                    <p>An interesting comet, which has afforded<br>much occupation to the
                        photographer, was<br>discovered on July 8th, 1893, by Mr.
                        Alfred<br>Rordame, an astronomer residing in Salt<br>Lake City. Mr. W.J.

                        were taken.<br>There is no doubt<br>that visual obser<br>vations would

                        plates are marked <br>over by numbers of bright streaks: these<br>are
                        the photographs of the stars which<br>happened to lie in the same field of
                        view as<br>the comet. But it may well be asked how it<br>has come to
                        pass that the stars are represented<br>by streaks instead of the round
                        images which<br>we should expect from their sun-like character.<br>The
                        explanation of this circumstance is not a<br>little curious and
                        instructive. The comet is<br>in motion, and in moves so rapidly that in
                        the<br>course of such a protracted exposure as that<br>on July 12th,
                        which lasted for one hour and<br>twelve minutes, the comet changes its
                        position<br>in the sky through a distance which is quite<br>apparent. If
                        the camera had been directed<br>throughout the exposure to the same part
                        of<br>the heavens, the comet, like the unquiet<br>sitter, would only
                        have permitted us to obtain a<br>very blurred and indistinct portrait.
                        To<br>obviate the effects of this motion it was<br>therefore necessary
                        for the astronomer<br>who was engaged in taking the picture to</div>

                    body had remained at rest during<br>the exposure. But the stars which
                    were<br>strewn over the background remained quiet<br>all the time; as,
                    however, the camera was<br>shifted, for the reason just mentioned,
                    it<br>follows that each of the stars, instead of<br>being represented by a
                    point, as it would<br>have been in an ordinary sidereal picture, is<br><span

                    <p>Such streaks, if<br>useless as stellar<br>pictures, are,
                        never-<br>theless, very in-<br>structive. They<br>reveal to us
                        the<br> nature and the<br>extent of the move-<br>ment of the
                        comet<br>during the period<br>which the exposure<br>has lasted.
                        The<br>length of the streak<br>expresses the appa-<br>rent
                        distance<br>through which the<br>comet has moved,<br>while the
                        direction<br>of the streak indi-<br>cates the direction<br>in which
                        the comet<br>is moving. At first<br>sight this latter<br>circumstance
                        may<br>appear somewhat<br>puzzling. We are<br>accustomed to see<br>a
                        shower of sparks<br>extending out be-<br>hind a sky-rocket,<br>and
                        this tail to the<br>rocket follows<br>generally the track<br>along
                        which the<br>rocket has itself<br>advanced. But the<br>tail of a
                        comet<br>bears a relation to<br>the comet very<br>different from
                        that<br>which the stream<br>of sparks behind a<br>rocket bears to
                        the<br>rocket itself. The<br>position of the<br>comet's tail is 
                </div>
                <div class="columnRight">governed by the remarkable law that it must<br>be turned
                    away from the sun. In fact, it<br>would generally be found that a line

                        flimsy character of the tail of a comet,<br>it may seem rather surprising

                        To<br>appreciate all that this implies we should note<br>that most of
                        the stars here concerned are in<br>truth very faint objects. They would,
                        under<br>any circumstances, be quite invisible to the<br>unaided eye.
                        Yet they are nevertheless dis<br>tinctly seen, notwithstanding the
                        interposition<br>of this stupendous volume of cometary matter.<br>Here,
                        then, we see that stars, even though they<br>be faint stars, can

                    hiding the stars. Yet the<br>light from those stars is so feeble that
                    the<br>slightest film of haze on a summer sky would<br>suffice to extinguish
                    them. This circum<br>stance shows, in a very striking manner,<br>how

                    different ways in which a body may be<br>rendered visible. In the first case,
                    it may<br>shine by its own light; in the second case,<br>it may simply show
                    the light reflected from<br>some other luminous body. The
                    illumation<br>dispensed by a sun or a star is of the first<br>kind; that
                    shed by the earth or any other<br>planet is of the second kind. The
                    first<br>question which we have to ask with regard to<br>the light received
                    from a comet may be thus<br>stated. Is this light due to some cause
                    of<br>luminosity in the comet itself, or is it merely<br>sunlight reflected
                    from the comet as from a<br>planet?<p>If we had been restricted to the use
                        of<br>telescopes, however powerful, it would hardly<br>have been
                        possible for us to have solved this<br>problem. The spectroscope has,
                        however,<br>the power of disentangling the component<br>rays in a beam
                        of light, and thus indicating<br>their character in such a way as enables
                        us<br>to learn what the source of the light may<br>have been. We thus
                        find that the light<br>emitted form a comet is, generally
                        speaking,<br>of a two-fold character. Part of it is un</div>
                <div class="imageRight">doubtedly reflected sunlight.<br>This is demonstrated
                    by<br>observations with the spec<br>troscope, which show that<br>part of

                    pre<br>cisely those lines and groups<br>of lines which are
                    distinctly<br>characteristic of sunlight.<br>The evidence on this
                    point<br>is quite convincing. We<br>should, indeed, have been<br>greatly
                    surprised had it been<br>otherwise; for when the<br>comet adventures so

                    character from a planet. The<br>splendour of Venus is due simply to
                    the<br>sunlight which falls upon it. Nor does the<br>great Jupiter himself
                    emit any rays beyond<br>those which he imperfectly reflects from the<br>sun.
                    The comet is, however, of a very<br>different nature from the more robust

                    due to incandescense in<br>the body itself. If the sun were to

                    moon and the planet would<br>instantly disappear from view; but the<br>comet
                    might still shine on. No doubt it<br>would lose some of its brightness,
                    and<br>probably the tail would be to a great extent<br>shorn of its original
                    proportions. There<br>would, however, be a certain amount of<br>cometary
                    light independent of the sun still<br>forthcoming, so that extinction would
