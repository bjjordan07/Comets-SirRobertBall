                            was<br>no other star in the universe<br>than our own sun, and let
                            us<br>further, for the sake of making<br>the argument clearer,
                            suppose<br>that the sun was deprived of its<br>system of attendant
                            worlds. Next, let some<br>other object be introduced which we
                            may<br>suppose to be extremely light, like a wisp of<br>vapour, and
                            let it be situated at a distance<br>from the sun which we may regard
                            as inde<br>finitely great. These two bodies, namely,<br>the sun and
                            this wisp of vapour, are then<br>supposed to be abandoned to their
                            mutual<br>attraction. Each of these objects will pull<br>the other,
                            and the result of the attraction<br>between the two bodies will be to
                            make them<br>approach each other. As, however, the<br>mass of the
                            sun is so vast, while the mass<br>of the wisp is so small, we may
                            fairly<br>assume that the greater part of this move<br>ment will be
                            done by the wisp, while the sun<br>will remain comparatively at rest.
                            The case<br>is indeed much of the same in this respect as in<br>the
                            fall of a stone to the ground. The stone<br>goes down to meet the
                            earth, but the earth<br>at the same time comes up to meet the
                            stone.<br>As, however, the earth is more massive than<br>millions of
                            millions of stones, the actual<br>movement performed by the earth is
                            in this<br>case quite unappreciable. We may therefore<br>say, with
                            truth enough for all practical<br>purposes, that it is the stone which
                            does all<br><span>the moving, while the earth remains at
                            rest.</span></p>
                        <p>In the same manner we may suppose the<br>sun to be at rest, while the
                            wisp of vapour<br>is drawn towards it from the depths of
                            space.<br>At first, no doubt the motion may be<br> extremely slow:
                            for the attraction of the<br>sun decreases with its distance.
                            Indeed,<br>the wisp of vapour might be so remote, that<br>it would
                            require thousands of years to move<br>over an inch. But as the motion
                            progresses<br>the body will gradually acquire speed, until<br>after
                            the lapse of a time, so long that we shall<br>not attempt to express
                            it in figures, the little<br>object will be found hurrying in towards
                            the<br>sun with the speed of an express train; still<br>the pace
                            will grow until the approaching<br>object will be moving as quickly as
                            a rifle<br>bullet. The intervening distance is now<br>rapidly
                            dimishing; but, as that distance</p>

                    <div class="columnRight" id="cR393"> lessens, the intensity of the solar
                        attraction<br>increases, and, consequently, the pace at<br>which the
                        object is urged onwards becomes<br>greater and greater. From moving at
                        the<br>rate of a mile in a second, the little object<br>would gradually
                        attain a speed not less<br>than that of the earth in its orbit,
                        namely,<br>about eighteen miles a second. Still<br>the body presses
                        onwards, until a pace could<br>be reached of 100 or 200 miles a
                        second.<br>Finally, when the vapour would be about to<br>make the
                        terrific plunge into the glowing sun,<br>its speed would be upwards of 400
                        miles a<br>second. The vastness of this speed may<br>be realized from
                        the fact that a body<br>animated by so great a velocity
                        would<br>accomplish a complete circuit of the earth<br><span>in about a
                            minute.</span><p>The case which I have supposed is, how<br>ever, not
                            exactly that of a comet. The<br>movement would hardly take place in
                            the<br>way just described, in which the sun and<br>the wisp of
                            vapour were both orginally<br>at rest. Such a state of things could
                            hardly<br>be possible in Nature. We may, no doubt,<br>suppose the
                            sun to have been at rest, for it<br>is only the relative movements of
                            the two<br>bodies which concern us. But we can hardly<br>imagine
                            that the wisp of vapour could have<br>been so delicately placed as to
                            have had<br>absolutely no motion whatever, except, in<br>deed, in
                            the direct line towards the sun. If,<br>at the moment of starting, the
                            object pos<br>essed a movement which would carry it in<br>the course
                            of time out of the direct line<br>to the sun, then a totally different
                                condition<br><span class="lastLine">of motion would be the
                                result.</span></p>
                        <p>All the time that the sun was drawing this<br>wisp of vapour towards
                            it, the transverse move<br>ment would be gradually moving the
                            wisp<br>out of the direct line. Now, though the<br>speed of that
                            movement may be very small,<br>yet in the lapse of those millions
                            of<br>years that are required to draw the body into the<br>sun, this
                            transverse movement will have<br>increased to such an extent that the
                            object<br>will the miss the sun instead of hitting it. In<br>fact,
                            after its stupendous voyage from the<br>indefinitely remote depths of
                            space, during<br>which it has acquired its vast speed of
                            scores<br>or hundreds of miles a second, the comet will<br>be found
                            not plunging into the sun, but </div>

                    <div class="columnLeft"> passing to one side of it. While the two <br>objects
                        are in such close proximity their <br>mutual attraction is, of course, of
                        tremendous <br>vehemence. In virtue of this attraction, the <br>rapidly
                        moving comet is whirled round the <br>sun, and consequently begins to
                        retreat again <br>towards the same side from which it has <br>come. In
                        this majestic sweep the comet <br>describes a graceful curve. Coming in
                        from <br>infinity it approaches the sun, wheels round <br>the sun, and
                        then again retires to the depths <span><br>of space.</span>
                        <p> As the comet has swept in towards the <br>sun, in consequence of the
                            attraction of that <br>body, it may seem difficult to understand
                            <br>why it should then retreat outwards again, <br>notwithstanding
                            the attraction which now <br>seeks to draw it back. This may, however,
                            <br>be illustrated by a very simple contrivance. <br>Let a weight be
                            hung from the ceiling by a <br>string. Let that weight be drawn to
                            aside and <br>then released. It will, of course, swing down <br>to
                            the lowest point, and then, having passed <br>through the lowest
                            point, the weight will <br>begin to ascend. The attraction of the
                            earth <br>pulls the body down, but as it descends it <br>acquires
                            speed, and in virtue of this speed <br>it is enabled to pass the
                            lowest point and to <br>ascend in opposition to gravity on the other
                            <br>side. In the same way, the speed acquired <br>by the comet in
                            its long voyage towards the <br>sun from the depths of space enables
                            it to <br>sweep round the sun without being captured, <br>and then
                            to pass away, perhaps, never more <br>to return. The nearer the comet
                            is to the <br>solar surface the greater is the speed with <br>which
                            it moves, and consequently the more <br>brief is its sojourn in the
                            vicinity of the sun. <br>A comet has, in fact, been known to graze the
                            <br>sun so closely that it passed within one- <br>seventh part of
                            the sun's radius. In this <br>case a period of two hours sufficed for
                            the <br>comet to completely turn round the sun<br><span
                                class="lastLine">and commence its retreat into space.</span></p>
                        <p>The actual circumstances presented in <br>Nature are not quite so
                            simple. We have <br>assumed that the sun and the comet were <br>the
                            solitary objects in the universe. Of <br>course, this condition is not
                            fulfilled. There <br>are the planets surrounding the sun, and
                            <br>then there are the countless hosts of stars. Some <br>of these
                            objects may attract the comet with <br>a vigour sufficient to sway it
                            considerably <br>from the track which it would otherwise <br>follow.
                            In consequence of these various <br>forces we are not justified in
                            discussing the <br>problem actually presented in Nature as <br>being
                            exactly the same as that in the case <br>hitherto supposed. But our
                            illustrations will,</div>
                    <div class="columnRight">at all events, suffice to give a general idea
                        of<br>what actually happens. The comets are<br>drawn in from the depths
                        of space, they<br>approach the sun, they sweep round the sun,<br>and
                        they then retreat again to the abyss from<br>which they have come. The
                        laws of mathe<br>matics assure us that it is quite possible for<br>an
                        object, after journeying from an immeasur<br>ably great distance for an
                        immeasurably long<br>time, to enter our system, to wheel round
                        the<br>sun and then again retreat to commence an<br>infinite voyage
                        which should last for all<br>eternity. It is perfectly certain that this
                        kind<br>of motion, which we know to be possible<br>does closely resemble
                        that actually performed<br>by many of the comets. These bodies
                        enter<br>our system, they come into the vicinity of the<br>earth, and,
                        under these circumstances, they<br>are accessible to our observation. As
                        they<br>retreat into space they gradually withdraw<br>from our view.
                        Many of the comets which<br>come to visit us appear to be objects
                        which<br>have never been within the ken of the earth<br>before, and
                        which will never be within the<br><span class="lastLine">ken of the earth
                            again.</span>
                        <p>There are, however, a few of these bodies<br>which describe orbits of a
                            different kind.<br>They move round in elliptic or oval paths,<br>so
                            that their visits to our vicinity and their<br>consequent visibility
                            to the inhabitants of<br>the earth recur with more or less
                            regularity.<br>Of such a nature is that most famous of
                            all<br>comets, which bears the name of the illustrious<br>astronomer
                            Halley. This splendid object<br>accomplishes a complete circuit around
                            the<br>sun every seventy-five years. It will again<br>display its

                        <p>Our knowledge of comets has been greatly<br>extended in the last few
                            years by the applica<br>tion of photographic methods to the
                            investi<br>gation of the heavens. Indeed, we are<br>evidently now
                            entering upon a new phase in<br>the history of these
                            mysterious<br>objects. The advantages of photography for<br>such
                            inquiries are obvious. In the first<br>place, the plates present to us
                            pictures of<br>absolute accuracy. This is a matter of<br>special
                            importance in this research, because<br>the appearance of comets
                            changes so in<br>cessantly, that unless the portrait of the<br>comet
                            obtained on any particular occasion<br>be absolutely faithful, it is
                            impossible to<br>correct it on any subsequent occasion. Not<br>only
                            from week to week does the comet alter<br>its appearance, but it
                            changes even from day<br>to day. It is, therefore, of the utmost
                            im<br>portance to obtain views of the body which<br>shall be of
                            unquestioned accuracy so far as</div>

                        photographic pictures of comets<br>are particularly instructive. It is a
                        pecu<br>liarity of the sensitive plate that it is able to<br>perceive
                        and record luminous expressions<br>quite too faint to produce any
                        impression on<br>the eye. <p>When we examine the photograph of
                            a<br>comet, we thus often find on it many details<br>which were
                            quite unseen by the observer, no<br>matter how acute his vision may
                            have been,<br>and no matter how powerful may be the<br>telescope
                            which he as been employing. It<br>is, indeed, sometimes found that the

                        <p>An interesting comet, which has afforded<br>much occupation to the
                            photographer, was<br>discovered on July 8th, 1893, by Mr.
                            Alfred<br>Rordame, an astronomer residing in Salt<br>Lake City. Mr.
                            W.J. Hussey obtained<br>some admirable photographs of this
                            object<br>at the Lick Obser<br>vatory, and we are<br>also indebted
                            to the<br>same astronomer<br>for a very interest<br>ing account of

                            structure of the<br>two tails. It would<br>seem as if
                            some<br>violent dislocation<br>of the material of<br>the tail must
                            have<br>taken place in the<br>interval which has<br>elapsed

                    <div class="columnRight">have established this point so clearly as
                        the<br>photographs have done. <p>It will be noticed that the plates are
                            marked over<br>by numbers of bright streaks: these<br>are the
                            photographs of the stars which<br>happened to lie in the same field of
                            view as<br>the comet. But it may well be asked how it<br>has come to
                            pass that the stars are represented<br>by streaks instead of the round
                            images which<br>we should expect from their sun-like
                            character.<br>The explanation of this circumstance is not
                            a<br>little curious and instructive. The comet is<br>in motion, and
                            in moves so rapidly that in the<br>course of such a protracted
                            exposure as that<br>on July 12th, which lasted for one hour
                            and<br>twelve minutes, the comet changes its position<br>in the sky
                            through a distance which is quite<br>apparent. If the camera had been
                            directed<br>throughout the exposure to the same part of<br>the
                            heavens, the comet, like the unquiet<br>sitter, would only have
                            permitted us to obtain a<br>very blurred and indistinct portrait.
                            To<br>obviate the effects of this motion it was<br>therefore
                            necessary for the astronomer<br>who was engaged in taking the picture

                        body had remained at rest during<br>the exposure. But the stars which
                        were<br>strewn over the background remained quiet<br>all the time; as,
                        however, the camera was<br>shifted, for the reason just mentioned,

                        is<br>manifested in this plate by a streak.</div>

                        They<br>reveal to us the<br> nature and the<br>extent of the
                        move<br>ment of the comet<br>during the period<br>which the
                        exposure<br>has lasted. The<br>length of the streak<br>expresses the
                        appa<br>rent distance<br>through which the<br>comet has
                        moved,<br>while the direction<br>of the streak indi<br>cates the
                        direction<br>in which the comet<br>is moving. At first<br>sight this
                        latter<br>circumstance may<br>appear somewhat<br>puzzling. We
                        are<br>accustomed to see<br>a shower of sparks<br>extending out
                        be<br>hind a sky-rocket,<br>and this tail to the<br>rocket
                        follows<br>generally the track<br>along which the<br>rocket has
                        itself<br>advanced. But the<br>tail of a comet<br>bears a relation
                        to<br>the comet very<br>different from that<br>which the
                        stream<br>of sparks behind a<br>rocket bears to the<br>rocket itself.
                        The<br>position of the<br>comet's tail is<br>governed by the
                        remarkable law that it must<br>be turned away from the sun. In fact,
                        it<br>would generally be found that a line drawn<br>through the comet
                        from the tail to the head<br>would, when continued around the
                        heavens,<br>point to the sun. <p>In the present case it is plain, from
                            the<br>position of the star tracks, that the motion of<br>the comet
                            happens to be almost perpendicular<br>to the direction of its tail.
                            Considering the<br>very flimsy character of the tail of a
                            comet,<br>it may seem rather surprising that this<br>structure

                        atmosphere exists in the open space<br>through which the comet wings its

                            of<br>the stars, when we remember that they form<br>a background
                            with respect to the comet. It<br>will be observed that many of the
                            stellar<br>streaks are visible right through the tail.
                            To<br>appreciate all that this implies we should note<br>that most
                            of the stars here concerned are in<br>truth very faint objects. They
                            would, under<br>any circumstances, be quite invisible to
                            the<br>unaided eye. Yet they are nevertheless dis<br>tinctly seen,
                            notwithstanding the interposition<br>of this stupendous volume of
                            cometary matter.<br>Here, then, we see that stars, even though

                        purpose of hiding the stars. Yet the<br>light from those stars is so

                        would<br>suffice to extinguish them. This circum<br>stance shows, in a

                        of<br>material which is contained in a comet.<br>We can admit this
                        without, perhaps, going<br>quite so far as to agree with those who
                        assert<br>that the tail of a notable comet may, never<br>theless,
                        contain no greater quantity of solid<br>material than<br>could be

                            object.<br>The picture shown<br>on the next page<br>was taken by
                            Pro<br>fessor E. E. Bar<br>nard, at the Lick<br>Observatory,
                            on<br>7th April, 1892.<br>This comet pos<br>esses a
                            feature<br>which may be said<br>to be without a<br>parallel in

                            displays<br>the actual forma<br>tion of a second<br>comet as a
                            part of the first. It can hardy be<br>doubted that this second comet
                            is destined<br>to assume an independent existence. Astro<br>nomers
                            had already known, in the case of<br>Biela's comet, that one of these

                    <div class="columnLeft">We must first explain that the are two<br>totally
                        different ways in which a body may be<br>rendered visible. In the first
                        case, it may<br>shine by its own light; in the second case,<br>it may
                        simply show the light reflected from<br>some other luminous body. The
                        illumation<br>dispensed by a sun or a star is of the first<br>kind; that
                        shed by the earth or any other<br>planet is of the second kind. The
                        first<br>question which we have to ask with regard to<br>the light
                        received from a comet may be thus<br>stated. Is this light due to some
                        cause of<br>luminosity in the comet itself, or is it merely<br>sunlight
                        reflected from the comet as from a planet? <p><br>If we had been
                            restricted to the use of<br>telescopes, however powerful, it would
                            hardly<br>have been possible for us to have solved this<br>problem.
                            The spectroscope has, however,<br>the power of disentangling the
                            component<br>rays in a beam of light, and thus indicating<br>their
                            character in such a way as enables us<br>to learn what the source of
                            the light may<br>have been. We thus find that the light<br>emitted
                            form a comet is, generally speaking,<br>of a two-fold character. Part
                            of it is un</div>
                    <div class="columnRight">doubtedly reflected sunlight.<br>This is demonstrated
                        by<br>observations with the spec<br>troscope, which show that<br>part
                        of the radiation from a<br>comet exhibits a continuous<br>spectrum,
                        marked by pre<br>cisely those lines and groups<br>of lines which are
                        distinctly<br>characteristic of sunlight.<br>The evidence on this
                        point<br>is quite convincing. We<br>should, indeed, have
                        been<br>greatly surprised had it been<br>otherwise; for when
                        the<br>comet adventures so near<br>the sun as it does in the<br>course
                        of its wanderings it<br>must be brilliantly lighted<br>up by the great
                        luminary,<br>and, of course, some por<br>tion of the splendour
                        thus<br>produced is naturally re<br>flected to us. <p>But besides the
                            bright<br>ness which comets possess<br>in virtue of the
                            sunlight<br>which they receive, it is<br>quite certain that they
                            are<br>also to be regarded as being<br>in a certain sense
                            light<br>generators themselves. In<br>this respect the comet is
                            at<br>once perceived to be a body of a totally<br>different
                            character from a planet. The<br>splendour of Venus is due simply to
                            the<br>sunlight which falls upon it. Nor does the<br>great Jupiter
                            himself emit any rays beyond<br>those which he imperfectly reflects
                            from the<br>sun. The comet is, however, of a very<br>different
                            nature from the more robust planets.<br>Part of the light which the
                            comet transmits<br>is unquestionably due to incandescense in<br>the
                            body itself. If the sun were to be<br>suddenly deprived of
                            light-giving power<br>while we were surveying the heavens
                            con<br>taining the moon and a planet and a bright<br>comet, then the
                            moon and the planet would<br>instantly disappear from view; but
                            the<br>comet might still shine on. No doubt it<br>would lose some of
                            its brightness, and<br>probably the tail would be to a great
                            extent<br>shorn of its original proportions. There<br>would,
                            however, be a certain amount of<br>cometary light independent of the
                            sun still<br>forthcoming, so that extinction would
                            not<br>necessarily overtake the comet as it<br><span

                        in<br>the rays of light, thus often enabling us to<br><span>trace each

                        <p>The first notable achievement in the<br>determination of the peculiar
                            character of<br>the radiation from a comet was made by<br>Dr.
                            Huggins in 1868. He showed that<br>some of the rays of a comet which
                            appeared<br>that year were indicative of the presence of<br>the
                            element carbon in the body of the object.<br>In the case of this
                            particular element the<br>available information carried us
                            somewhat<br>further than is often the case. Not only was<br>the
                            existence of the element demonstrated, but<br>the particular chemical
                            combination in which<br>that element appeared was disclosed. By
                            its<br>union with hydrogen, carbon gives rise to<br>an important
                            series of compounds. The<br>substances thus produced are very
                            familiar.<br>It need only be mentioned that the common<br>petroleum,
                            which we use in our lamps, is a<br>combination of carbon and hydrogen!
                            The<br>spectrum of a hydro-carbon, as one of these<br>compounds is
                            termed, is of such a charac<br>teristic nature that it can be used as
                            a<br>test to show whether the hydro-carbon<br>itself is present. Dr.
                            Huggins compared the<br>spectrum of the comet now referred to
                            with<br>the spectrum of these hydro-carbons. The<br>identity between
                            the two spectra was noted,<br>and thus a splendid addition was a
                            once<br>made to our knowledge. Subsequent research<br>has confirmed
                            the important discovery that<br>hydro-carbons are characteristic
                                components<br><span class="lastLine">of many comets.</span></p>
                        <p>For many years no further important<br>addition was made to our
                            knowledge of the<br>elementary substances present in
                            these<br>wandering bodies. The light they dispensed<br>appeared to
                            be partly the reflected light from<br>the sun, and partly the light
                            due to incan<br>descent hydro-carbons. But in 1882 a
                            great<br>advance was made. A comet was discovered<br>that year in
                            Albany, by Mr. Wells. At first,<br>this body showed the bright
                            continuos<br>spectrum due to reflected sunlight, while
                            the<br>indications of the presence of hydro-carbon</div>
                    <div class="columnRight" id="cR399">were mainly confined to the
                        neighborhood<br>of the nucleus. After this interesting<br>object had
                        adorned the heavens for a<br>couple of months Dr. Copeland, now
                        the<br>distinguished Astronomer-Royal of Scotland,<br>discovered a
                        bright yellow line in the spectrum<br>indicating the presence of sodium.
                        This<br>observation was of particular importance,<br>inasmuch as it
                        afforded at once direct<br>evidence of the presence in these
                        celestial<br>wanderers of another element specially re<br>markable in
                        its terrestrial relations. An<br>emphatic confirmation of Copeland's
                        dis<br>covery was presently forthcoming. It is well<br>known that the
                        bright yellow line indicative<br>of the presence of sodium is seen to
                        be<br>double when examined under suitable cir<br>cumstances. As the
                        comet appraoched the<br>sun the characteristic sodium light
                        became<br>quite strong. The nucleus glared with the<br>distinct yellow
                        hue belonging to this element;<br>and, indeed, by filtering away all other
                        light<br>in a process with which a spectroscopist is<br>familiar, an
                        outline of the head of the comet<br>was obtained which was produced by
                            sodium<br><span>light alone.</span>
                        <p>To Dr. Copeland and Dr. Lohse at the <br>Earl of Crawford's observatory
                            in Dunecht<br>we are also indebted for yet one more im<br>portant
                            addition to our knowledge of the com<br>position of these bodies. In
                            the autumn of<br>1882 we were visited by another comet,
                            which<br>must rank as one of the most famous of these<br>objects
                            which have appeared during this<br>century. On the 18th September,
                            1882, the<br>two astronomers I have named observed in<br>the
                            spectrum of this comet, not only the<br>sodium line, but also six
                            other lines.<br>The places of these were carefully measured,<br>and
                            it was found afterwards that they were<br>undoubtedly the chief lines
                            of the iron spec<br>trum. Here was, indeed, another notable
                            dis<br>covery. The element iron, of such transcen<br>dent importance
                            to us on the earth, is now<br>known to be a constituent of the
                                cometary<br><span class="lastLine">wanderers throughout
                                space.</span></p>
                        <p>Thus we have learned that the principal<br>elements in comets are among
                            the common<br>substances on the earth. Here, again, we<br>find
                            additional testimony to that fundamental<br>unity in the composition
                            of heavenly bodies,<br>the perception of which is one of the
                                most<br><span class="lastLine">notable results in modern
